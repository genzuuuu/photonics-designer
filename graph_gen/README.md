## Graph structure generation

In this section, we train a trasformer-based model to generate the adjacency matrix of a graph state given a set of desired gates to implement.

We identify viable graph states following the approach described by [JC Adcock in his PhD thesis](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/202643120/Jeremy_C._Adcock_Ph.D_thesis_Generating_Optical_Graph_States_v2.pdf)
