       "'Programmable photonic circuits play a crucial role in advancing optical computing, which aims to use light instead of electrical signals for computation. These circuits allow for the manipulation and control of light signals, enabling various functionalities required for optical computing systems. Here are some specific ways programmable photonic circuits help in optical computing:\\n\\n1. Light signal routing: Programmable photonic circuits can route light signals through different paths within the circuit, similar to how electrical signals are routed in electronic circuits. This routing capability allows for flexible and dynamic connectivity between different components of an optical computing system.\\n\\n2. Optical signal processing: Optical computing relies on manipulating light signals to perform computations. Programmable photonic circuits offer the ability to process optical signals, such as modulating the intensity, phase, or polarization of light. This allows for tasks like filtering, amplification, and wavelength conversion, which are essential for optical computing operations.\\n\\n3. Reconfigurability: Programmable photonic circuits can be reconfigured to adapt to different computing tasks or changing computational requirements. By reprogramming the circuit, users can modify the functionality of the optical system, enabling it to perform various operations like logic operations, data storage, or image processing.\\n\\n4. Parallel processing: Optical computing takes advantage of the parallel nature of light signals to perform computations faster than traditional electronic systems. Programmable photonic circuits facilitate the parallel processing of multiple light signals simultaneously, enhancing the computational power of optical computing systems.\\n\\n5. Integration with electronic components: Optical computing often requires the integration of optical and electronic components. Programmable photonic circuits can interface with electronic circuits, allowing for seamless integration of optical and electronic functionalities. This integration enables hybrid systems that combine the benefits of both optics and electronics for efficient computing.\\n\\nIn summary, programmable photonic circuits provide essential capabilities for optical computing, including signal routing, processing, reconfigurability, parallel processing, and integration with electronic components. These circuits play a vital role in enabling the development of efficient and high-performance optical computing systems.'"

    "## Summary\n",
    "Here, this is a basic agent based on the OpenAI models which can answer the photonics questions based on the retrieval we created, answer some questions that need real-time information based on the search tool Tavily and help find some paper via google scholar search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "After trying to build a LLM with LangChain, first of all, I think it may be a useful tool for us to start some work in the human-computer interaction part. In that part, the model needs to collect users' questions and needs, and after thinking about it, the model should clarify some details through further communication with users, which is more conducive to the accuracy of subsequent service script generation. The LangChain with the use of OpenAI API can provide a basic chatbot with the remaining conversation history function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing that LangChain can help with, I think, is the building of our knowledge graph. With some embedding function, we can let the model ingest some paper or other useful information we want it to learn. And use the retrieval chain to answer the question by combining knowledge together."
